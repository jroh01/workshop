Joshua Blumenstock
Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development Nature: Sept. 2018

Question
Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis.

Additionally, consider the following statements from three of your classmates regarding this article.

“Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people’s experiences” Anna Raymond

“Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results” Nira Nair

“In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult.” Kayla Seggelke

How do you respond to these ideas regarding “good intent”, “transparency” and the difficult “balancing act” when considering the intersection of human development with data science?
