Reading: Joshua Blumenstock - 
Don’t forget people in the use of big data for development Nature: Sept. 2018

  In his article about how a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years, Joshua Blumenstock presents the promise, pitfalls, and ways forward to address his thesis. 
  
  
  For the promise, Blumenstock addresses that data from mobile phones and satellites can be used to make the allocation of resources to those who need them much more efficient. He states that data from mobile phones such as whether or not the individual makes international calls and data from satellites such as generated images of different types of houses can accurately identify and distinguish areas with high poverty rates and the wealthier areas, allowing for a more accurate distribution of humanitarian aid. He also states that phone data can help reveal areas that have been affected by natural disasters or diseases, improving public health interventions. 
  
  
  However, Blumenstock addresses that there are four major problems or pitfalls in this approach. First, he states that unanticipated effects may happen, as this new way of drawing data will be concentrated in the hands of the empowered. Next, he states that there is a lack of validation as this, being a new system, has not had enough time to be tested for any problems. Then, he mentions that this runs on a biased algorithm and can lead to misrepresentation as the most needy would not even have the required electric power and connectivity for their data to be collected. Lastly, he fears that this new system will have a lack of regulation surrounding it. 
  
  
  Blumenstock does present ways forward to address these pitfalls. He states that this new way of collecting data should be adding on to the old ways not replacing them. He also states that this new way should be customized to fit the environment and the context that it is being used for. Finally, he states that this new way should be done through a collaboration between data scientists, development experts, governments, civil society, and the private sector in order for it to truly be useful. 
  

I feel like good intent should really be considered carefully in the intersection of human development with data science. The reason why is because of how accessible data can be. Even if one individual views and gains data with "good intention," the result could be used by those with "bad intentions." As for transparency, I feel like it will remain a  highly controversial topic, as it can relate to the topic of privacy. I feel that transparency is needed for the correct use of data science, but I also feel that how much transparency will become a topic of issue. I do think that through a reasonable level of transparency, the balancing act will become easier as collaboration may also become easier.
